			Personal Summary
		</h2>
		<p>
			I have a good amount of personal experience related to the Information Architect role. Most recently was my group project
			in CSC 210, Web Programming. My primary role in the group was that of a project manager. I managed the project overview,
			structure, and Github repository, restructuring as necessary, and taught my teammates how to use Github. I also managed
			all communication within the group, as well as between TA's and the Professor to set up meetings and presentations. I
			really enjoyed working in this role!
