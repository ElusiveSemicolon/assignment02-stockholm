			Former Apple Specialist
		</h2>
		<p>
			From November of 2015 through August of 2017, I worked as a Specialist at an Apple Retail Store. As a self-proclaimed Apple
			enthusiast, I had always wanted to work for the company in any capacity and applied for a retail spot when I turned 18.
			A full year later, I received an email invitation to a hiring event, Apple’s unique but effective format of selecting
			its employees. After five total interviews/events and a month of training and shadowing, I was officially a Specialist
			at Apple.
		</p>

		<p>
			Working for Apple, even at the retail level, was an incredible experience. The entire 90+ employee team worked and communicated
			together like nothing I had ever seen before, and it was clear that Apple Corporate had a genuine respect for its retail
			workers. Over the course of my almost two years at Apple, I developed a number of strong relationships with my coworkers,
			and it really did feel like a family; you would be very hard-pressed to find a retail setting that incorporates this level
			of team-building, and Apple nails it. I left the company in August of 2017 to focus on schoolwork, as I work towards graduating
			in the Spring and pursuing a position in software or web engineering.
		</p>

			Certified Baseball Umpire
		</h2>
		<p>
			I also currently hold the position of Certified High School Baseball Umpire in the New York State Base Umpires association,
			through the Genesee Valley chapter. I have served as an official for school-sponsored and tournament baseball since March
			of 2015, ranging from 10-year-old travel baseball, to JV and Varsity high school baseball, and college-level baseball
			in more recent years. I achieved certified status in March of 2017 after being named the 2016 Prospect of the Year, an
			organization award that recognizes the most successful up-and-coming official currently apart of the organization. I began
			officiating varsity-and-college-level baseball for the 2017 season, and I will be participating in my second year of both
			levels beginning this Spring. I plan to continue in the organization for as long as I can, and I hope to increase the
			number of college-level games that I am able to be a part of as my experience grows.
		</p>

		<h2 class="title is-2">
			Academics
		</h2>
		<p>
			As a senior in computer science graduating in the Spring, I am currently taking four CS courses in order to complete my degree.
			Among my most highly-anticipated are CSC 242, Artificial Intelligence, and CSC 174, Advanced Front-End Web Development.
			I have always been interested in AI and the way that computers can think fo themselves, but my true interest was sparked
			by the class I took my senior year of high school. It was a class based on current events and current technology, and
			my interest in that class directly translated into my college career.
		</p>

		<p>
			Over the past seven semesters here at the University of Rochester, I have had an interesting journey. Since my high school
			did not have a computer science department, I did not have any programming experience whatsoever when I starting school
			here in the Fall of 2014. I held an immense interest in the world of technology however, so I was pretty set coming in
			about the major choice of computer science. During Freshman orientation, I met with a pre-major adviser, who will remain
			unnamed. During this meeting, which only lasted a few minutes, I was asked how much programming experience I already had,
			to which I responded that I had no prior experience whatsoever. To say the least, the look on my advisor’s face made me
			switch my major to chemistry (huge mistake). I figured I that I loved AP Chemistry in high school and I had college credit
			for it, so why not?! Well I most definitely learned why not… I’m back in computer science now, I certainly do not have
			that same advisor!
		</p>

		<p>
			It took me no more than one semester (and a D-) in CHM II to realize that chemistry was not for me. I think back at that
			now and wonder what I was thinking. I went the rest of my sophomore year without a major in mind, but I began taking computer
			science class again to see how I would do. After taking CSC 170 and loving it, I took 171 (Intro to Java) and 172 (Data
			Structures and Algorithms) and realized that CS was definitely the major for me. I declared my major later than normal,
			in the fall of my Junior year, but I was finally on the right track.
		</p>

			Projects
			</h1>
			<p>
				Over the course of my CS career, I have work on quite a few class projects. The one project that stands out to me is my final
				project from CSC 171. Tasked with the choice of picking either a rocket driving game or basket catch game, our assignment
				was to create one of these games in the Java language using what we had learned over the semester. Being my first adventure
				into a graphical game, I was incredible excited to see my outcome. In the end, it was a fully-functional rocket driving
				adventure featuring obstacles, enemies, and boss fights. It was this project alone that gave me the idea of potentially
				working in video game development.
			</p>

			<p>
				More recently in my computer science career was my first ever hackathon. In December of 2017, I participated in YHack at
				Yale University in Connecticut, a 48+ hour continuous computer science competition that pitted 2000 undergrad students
				in teams of up to four against the rest in a competition to create the best computer or device programs. While I didn’t
				take home any prizes, it was certainly an incredible experience. It was the first time I had really gotten to work with
				a dedicated development team to build a application with a strict deadline. We didn’t end up finishing completely, but
				in the end we did have a working prototype of our medication finder web application. It was definitely an experience
				I would recommend, and I would have loved to participate in more of them over my academic career.
